# Fugerit Document Generation Framework (fj-doc)

## Apache POI Renderer (XLS/XLSX)(fj-doc-mod-poi)

[back to fj-doc index](../README.md)  

*Status* :  
Most basic features implemented. (proper color and font handling missing).
  
*Quickstart* :  
Basically this is only a type handler, see core library [fj-doc-base](../fj-doc-base/README.md).  
NOTE: If you have any special need you can open a pull request or create your own handler based on this.
